# Copernicus Connect

**Copernicus Connect** is a QGIS plugin that makes it easy to browse, download, and visualise Copernicus data directly in QGIS.

It provides a user-friendly interface for discovering and querying datasets from the [WEkEO platform](https://wekeo.copernicus.eu/) using the Harmonized Data Access (HDA) API. The plugin also supports adding WMS and WMTS services to your QGIS project.

> To request data from WEkEO, you need a free user account, which can be created at [https://wekeo.copernicus.eu/register](https://wekeo.copernicus.eu/register).
