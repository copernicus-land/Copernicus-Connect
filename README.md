# Copernicus Connect

**Copernicus Connect** is a QGIS plugin that makes it easy to browse, download, and visualise Copernicus data directly in QGIS.

It provides a user-friendly interface for discovering and querying datasets from the [WEkEO platform](https://wekeo.copernicus.eu/) using the Harmonized Data Access (HDA) API. The plugin also supports adding WMS and WMTS services to your QGIS project.

> To request data from WEkEO, you need a free user account, which can be created at [https://wekeo.copernicus.eu/register](https://wekeo.copernicus.eu/register).

You can download the plugin as a ZIP file and install it in QGIS via the Plugin Installer:

1. **Download** Go to the project’s “[Releases](https://github.com/copernicus-land/Copernicus-Connect/releases)” on GitHub and download the latest ZIP package (e.g., `Copernicus-Connect 08.zip`).
2. In QGIS, go to **Plugins ▶ Manage and Install Plugins…**.
3. Select the **Install from ZIP** tab, browse to the downloaded ZIP file, and click **Install Plugin**.
